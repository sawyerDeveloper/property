# Property

Property is a Full Stack React/React-Native/GraphQL/Node app for managing properties in real time. 

## Installation

I use ngrok(https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) for tunneling the https for local ios dev.

Follow the instructions on the page.

Take the https address and add it to a ```config/development.json``` file that matches ```config/default.json```.

Make sure you have expo-cli ```npm install -g expo-cli```

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
expo start
```
