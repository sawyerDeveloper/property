# Property

Property is a Full Stack React/React-Native/GraphQL/Node app for managing properties in real time. 

## Installation

I use ngrok(https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) for tunneling the https for local ios dev.

Follow the instructions on the page.

Take the https address and add it to a ```config/development.json``` file that matches ```config/default.json```.

Make sure you have expo-cli ```npm install -g expo-cli```

Install dependencies ```npm install```


## Usage

To see ios and android:

```bash 
expo start
```

To see the web version:

```bash 
npm run web
```
